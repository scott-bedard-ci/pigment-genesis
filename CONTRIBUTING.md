# Contributing to Pigment-Genesis Design System

Welcome to the Pigment-Genesis design system! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively using Claude Code as your design system engineer.

## üéØ PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: PERFECTION IS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE STANDARD

**CRITICAL MINDSET:** Building each component perfectly is infinitely more important than building components quickly. Take ALL the time necessary to achieve perfection.

- **Quality over speed** - Never rush component development
- **100% compliance required** - Partial implementation is complete failure
- **Time is not a factor** - Spend whatever time needed for perfection
- **Cost is not a consideration** - Perfect implementation matters more than efficiency

## üéØ For New Team Members Using Claude Code

### Getting Started

1. **Open Claude Code** in this project directory
2. **Claude Code will automatically read** `.claude-instructions.md` and behave as the design system engineer
3. **Say "I'm ready to add a new component"** to begin the component creation process
4. **Provide Figma frame links** when requested for accurate design implementation

### The Claude Code Advantage

Claude Code acts as your expert design system engineer that:
- ‚úÖ **Ensures 100% design fidelity** to Figma specifications
- ‚úÖ **Maintains consistent patterns** across all components  
- ‚úÖ **Generates comprehensive tests** and documentation automatically
- ‚úÖ **Creates SwiftUI equivalents** for iOS development
- ‚úÖ **Follows accessibility best practices** in every component
- ‚úÖ **Uses design tokens exclusively** for instant rebrand capability

## üö® Critical Rules

### Design-First Development
- **NEVER create components without Figma designs** - Claude Code will refuse to build "standard" components
- **ALL design values must come from Figma** - no assumptions or hardcoded values
- **Every component must be rebrand-ready** through design token usage
- **Provide complete Figma frame access** for accurate implementation

### Quality Standards
- **100% TypeScript coverage** with proper interfaces
- **Comprehensive test coverage** including accessibility tests
- **Mobile-first responsive design** with desktop enhancements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** for all interactive elements
- **Complete Storybook documentation** with usage examples

## üîÑ Component Development Process

### 1. Preparation Phase
```bash
# Ensure you have latest codebase
git pull origin main
npm install

# Start development environment
npm run dev
```

### 2. Component Creation with Claude Code

#### Step 1: Initiate Component Creation
Say to Claude Code:
```
I'm ready to add a new component
```

#### Step 2: Provide Figma Frame Links
Claude Code will request Figma frames. Provide all relevant links:
```
Here are the Figma frames for the Button component:
- Default state: https://figma.com/file/abc123/design?node-id=1:2
- Hover state: https://figma.com/file/abc123/design?node-id=1:3  
- Disabled state: https://figma.com/file/abc123/design?node-id=1:4
- All size variants: https://figma.com/file/abc123/design?node-id=1:5
```

#### Step 3: Let Claude Code Analyze and Build
Claude Code will:
1. ‚úÖ **Verify Figma access** and extract design specifications
2. ‚úÖ **Extract design tokens** (colors, spacing, typography, effects)
3. ‚úÖ **Build React component** using tokens exclusively
4. ‚úÖ **Generate comprehensive tests** with accessibility coverage
5. ‚úÖ **Create Storybook stories** with responsive demos
6. ‚úÖ **Generate SwiftUI equivalent** for iOS development
7. ‚úÖ **Update documentation** and component registry

### 3. Review and Refinement

#### Automated Quality Checks
```bash
# Run all quality checks
npm run lint && npm run type-check && npm test
```

#### Design Fidelity Review
- Compare built component with Figma designs
- Test responsive behavior across breakpoints
- Verify accessibility with screen readers
- Test keyboard navigation

#### Cross-Platform Consistency
- Review SwiftUI equivalent for iOS design consistency
- Test design token usage for rebrand capability

## üìã Component Creation Checklist

### Before Starting
- [ ] Figma designs are complete and accessible
- [ ] Design tokens are defined in Figma
- [ ] Component scope is clearly defined
- [ ] Atomic design level is determined (Atom/Molecule/Organism)

### During Development (Claude Code handles these automatically)
- [ ] All design values extracted from Figma (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] Design tokens used exclusively
- [ ] Responsive behavior implemented (mobile-first)
- [ ] Accessibility features added (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined
- [ ] Comprehensive tests written
- [ ] Storybook stories created
- [ ] SwiftUI equivalent generated

### After Development
- [ ] Visual review matches Figma designs
- [ ] Responsive behavior tested
- [ ] Accessibility manually tested
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## üß™ Testing Standards

### Required Test Coverage
```typescript
// Example comprehensive test structure
describe('Button Component', () => {
  // Automated by Claude Code
  runStandardComponentTests(Button, {
    variants: ['primary', 'secondary', 'outline'],
    sizes: ['sm', 'md', 'lg'],
    requiredProps: { children: 'Test' }
  });

  // Component-specific tests
  describe('Button-specific behavior', () => {
    it('handles click events correctly', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

### Accessibility Testing
```bash
# Run accessibility test suite
npm run test:a11y

# Manual testing checklist
- [ ] Screen reader navigation
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation  
- [ ] Focus management
- [ ] Color contrast verification
- [ ] Touch target size verification
```

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Storybook Stories
Claude Code automatically generates:
- **Default story** with standard props
- **All variants showcase** showing every option
- **Responsive demo** across breakpoints
- **Accessibility demo** with focus states
- **Design token usage** documentation

### Component Documentation
```typescript
/**
 * Button - Primary interactive element
 * 
 * Built from Figma designs with automatic SwiftUI equivalent.
 * Uses design tokens exclusively for instant rebrand capability.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <Button variant="primary" size="md" onClick={handleClick}>
 *   Click me
 * </Button>
 * ```
 */
```

## üé® Design Token Workflow

### Token Extraction from Figma
```bash
# Extract latest tokens from Figma
npm run extract-figma-tokens

# Update all design token files
npm run update-design-tokens

# Generate SwiftUI tokens
npm run sync-swiftui-tokens
```

### Rebrand Process
```bash
# Complete rebrand workflow
npm run rebrand
```

This command:
1. Extracts updated tokens from Figma
2. Regenerates all token files
3. Updates SwiftUI equivalents
4. Rebuilds component library
5. Updates Storybook documentation

## üîß Development Tools

### Required Tools

## ‚ùó Common Issues and Solutions

### Figma Access Issues
**Problem**: Claude Code cannot access Figma frames
**Solution**: 
1. Verify Figma sharing permissions
2. Check MCP Figma connection
3. Provide direct frame URLs with proper access

### Design Token Mismatches  
**Problem**: Component doesn't match Figma design
**Solution**:
1. Re-extract tokens: `npm run extract-figma-tokens`
2. Verify Figma design token definitions
3. Check component token usage

### Accessibility Violations
**Problem**: Tests fail with accessibility errors
**Solution**:
1. Run `npm run test:a11y` for specific errors
2. Use browser dev tools accessibility panel
3. Test with actual screen readers

### SwiftUI Generation Issues
**Problem**: SwiftUI components don't match React components
**Solution**:
1. Verify design token consistency
2. Re-run `npm run sync-swiftui-tokens`
3. Check iOS-specific design requirements
